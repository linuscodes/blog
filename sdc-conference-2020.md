**Another time at the Social Developers Club Conference** and it was awesome! Meeting like-minded people is just an honor. But let me start at the beginning...

Basically, it was the same procedure as ~~last year~~ every year and Julia sent me a mail with the invitation to participate in the second conference organized by [@socialdevelopersclub](https://instagram.com/socialdevelopersclub).

I signed up and really looked forward to the day with the date March 07, 2020. It has been a while since I met all the aspiring developers and content creators, so now it's time again.

After a little bowl of muesli for breakfast Bini and Julia started with their welcoming talk and a little intro on some essential tips to protect yourself from the `COVID-19` â€“ including some non-touching handshakes and greetings.

The opening talk was followed by a talk of [Rob](https://instagram.com/) telling the crowd about #100daysofcode, what the benefits are and how to join this challenge. It was an awesome talk and made me think about starting this challenge as well to improve my skills in certain areas and also work on my self-discipline.

After a little coffee break and a seat-change, Stefanie Langner from Leankoala talked about why (not) to start a tech-startup. Was a really interesting talk with some insights about their business.
