I've been searching for an option to build a fast and slight blog, without having to get back to wordpress or whatever. Some time ago, I stumbled across "GoHugo", which basically renders static `html` files from templates with components.

I am deploying this project on Vercel (earlier: ZEIT) and it works just fine!
