   With this post, I am starting one of my biggest plans and ideas that I had during the quaratine due to covid-19. Self reflection is really important, so: here we are! I have ever admired people doing this without any struggle or anxiety and just saying their thoughts out loud. Not only that, but also being critical about myself has been a hard journey.

   Today we're talking not living for the moment but still hanging in the past. Or just focusing on the future and what's happening in one year, rather than enjoying the current place we are in.
