	It’s been ruffly four months since my last post and the moment I realized that I needed a break from social media. I haven’t been offline completely, but I focused on other things and projects that didn’t leave a big time slot to post content. Still, I am happy to be back with some new ideas and topics I want to write about.
</p>
<p>
	During my absence, I spent a week in berlin together with <a href="https://instagram.com/schaefkn" target="_blank">@schaefkn</a> to work on our beloved project "Meet". I also had the chance to meet <a href="https://instagram.com/jayflores.bcl" target="_blank">@jayflores.bcl</a> in person to have some really good conversations. Besides that, I turned sixteen last week which also made me think a lot about my current life and what I want to change about it. There definitely will be some change. Some forced by given circumstances, and some on a voluntary basis. Looking forward to that! ⁣

	Furthermore, school started again and with that, the most time-consuming part in my life is back. Luckily, I have a two-week autumn break from this day on. That means more time to work but also for some rest and a weekend off with my fam 🦦🦋 ⁣

<p>
	So far with my little life-update. I hope everyone of you is doing well and getting along with everything! Have a good week and see you in the next post 🤩👋🏻
