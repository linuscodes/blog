 Minimalism is truly a huge topic and everyone has a different idea and imagination of it. Some are already well introduced and practice this lifestyle on a daily basis, while others still think that the only way to be a minimalist is to own two t-shirts, one book or that you have to sleep on the blank floor. Even though this would probably work out, it is not a desirable practice to approach. And it is not the definition of minimalism, at all.

Being more mindful when making decisions and looking after how much you really need for an enjoyable life are two points that I would identify with the purpose of a minimal life. But that doesn’t need to count for everyone. Moreover, there are different categories that all have their roots in the principles of minimalism, even if you can’t spot them at a glance.

Just like there is minimalism in design and photography, you can also experience it on someone’s phone or in their inventory. Every so often you can also come across minimalism that you can’t see at all. That’s mostly because people are just living their lives in a more intentional way, where they simply approach many things in a different and more purposeful way.

However, minimalism is not to be mixed up with any restrictions or things “taken away” from you. De-cluttering and sorting out unused stuff is something many people who identify themselves as minimalists did or do on a regular basis. Just how they like it and how it works best. Now let me give you some more insights on how I approach a minimalist life.

 I would identify as a minimalist in progress. Mostly in the digital area (be it design or phone usage), as well as with the things I own. Lastly, I am also trying to keep a better eye on how much money I spend and – most importantly: on what. Especially the last point is a big construction site for myself. Not because I have to much money, but because I am a big fan of tech and beautifully crafted items.

Since February 2020 (yes, that horrible year) besides going to school, I started working as a freelancer to increase my pocket money just a little. That “just a little” straightforwardly turned into a good amount of income I have each month which is also an awesome invitation on directly spending it on one more item on my wishlist.
