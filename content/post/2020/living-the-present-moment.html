<p>
	I frequently find myself either thinking about things that happened a while ago or worrying about my future and how things will turn out. All this, without appreciating the current moment and the only time that is available to actually change things.
</p>
<p>
	Living in the present moment makes you able to use your time wisely and to recognize that it is the only thing we have. Anything else has already happened or will be happening, regardless of how much you’re worrying about it.

	Again and again, I’ve been taught that time is passing so fast that when you don’t live it up to the fullest, you will never live at all. Currently, I’m at a stage in my life where many things are changing. My mum recently left her job after working 23 years at that company. My dad is not able to work at the moment due to some health issues. In addition, my mum and me need to give up our flat by the middle of next year. It’s been 16 years in this crib and I will miss it for sure.

	But as long as I could be worried about all these things, I can also just accept them and move on. It is about learning to adopt to new situations and seasons that are constantly changing and flipping your world upside down.
