   It all started with a post that I scrolled over on instagram. It said somethink like: "We suffer more often in imagination than in reality. There is nothing in this world that can trouble you as much as your own thougts. <b>Stop overthinking!</b>". I posted it into my story asking "Anyone knows how to fix this? ðŸ¥º" and I got a lot of really aspiring messages regarding the problem. And what made me really happy: I realized that I am definitely not alone with this!

   Overthinking is sadly a big part of my life. In a way, it is normal to spend more thoughts on thinks than you should. BUT overthinking your overthought (is this even a word?!) and spending tons of hours with it, is getting a little too much.

   However, the responses I got on my instagram messages were pretty damn good and I'd like to share some with you.

   Just be a bit more impulsive about actions. Donâ€™t exactly know how to write a component? Just start writing and if itâ€™s crap it can be fixed :)

   I also had a good conversation about this with <a href="https://instagram.com/schaefkn">@schaefkn</a>. He told me about <i>fear setting</i> where you declare your biggest fear and afterwards recognize that it actually wasn't that worse at all. Looking forward to test this method and I'll let you know how it's going.
