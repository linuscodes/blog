**What‚Äôs up everybody?** Great to see you hanging out over here! As the title already described very straightforward: I am back!<!--more-->

This is the very second post to this _digital notebook_, which I actually built using [GoHugo](https://gohugo.io). And I am speechless because it‚Äôs super simple to use and start creating a small and basic blog or website. I actually did mine following [this tutorial](https://flaviocopes.com/start-blog-with-hugo/). Super simple and easy to understand

With that being said, welcome back! It has been a while and I just want to give you a little overview what this blog will be about.

Since I‚Äôm a person who is more off the quite tribe, most of the things happen inside my head and sometimes it is a great step to write them down and somewhat make them accessible for more people. So here we are!

This blog will contain shared thoughts about **design**, **development**, **mindset**, **motivation** and other random things popping up in my mind.
