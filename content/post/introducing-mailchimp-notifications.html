   What's up everyone? Hope you're having a great time!

   Currently, I am on holidays for a week, but that does not make any difference at all. We're even given some tasks by our teachers over the time.
</p>
<p>
   Anyway, today, I spent some time on setting up a mail notification system on mailchimp, which fetches data from my rss feed an sends out a mail when there is a new post being released. There were some issues I needed to fix with my rss generator and also the mail template, but I am pretty happy with the result.

   All of this means that we're getting serious about this blog. It's a bit of a weird feeling when pushing my new post to github to get it deployed on Vercel (earlier: ZEIT) but hey, we all have some fears ^^
</p>
<p>
   This also means, that I need to even more upper the value of my content to share. I have some topics in mind that I want to write about sometime but I'd also love to hear from you! What should I write about? What would you be interested in? Shoot me <a href="mailto:moin@linuscodes.com" class="link">a mail</a> or write me on <a href="https://instagram.com/linuscodes" class="link">instagram @linuscodes</a> to get in contact!

   Last but not least, I want to share a little <i>easter egg</i> from my mails with you. If you have a look at the footer of the mail, you can easily spot the "unsubscribe me" button. And this is on purpose: I don't want you to get annoyed by my mails so you are able to unsubscribe at any time.
</p>
<p>
   You may ask yourself now: What did you do that? Don't you lose readers of your blog then? â€“ Yes, but there will be still more people reading it, when they don't get mails that block their inboxes (not saying that mine do, but with many newsletters subscribed, it can get a little messy)

   So this is it! I hope you enjoyed this post and maybe I'll see you on my list! (Gonna implement it into this page very soon)
