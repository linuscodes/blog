This is just a quick shoutout to everyone to take a little bit care of yourself and others. Since COVID19 is hanging around all over the world, it is important to avoid crowded places and stay at home whenever possible! Also wash your hands peeps, here is how: <!--more-->

And also leave the toilet paper in the stores if you got enough at home. (Except you are going to get the P*rnhub Premium for free for one month, in case you are from Italy xD)

On thing which is really funny is that most of the schools around the world are already closed and there’s online lessons. And in Germany? The politicians are still debating whether thousands of students should go to school after the holidays. I mean — What the fuck?

Anyway, stay safe and #devinitelyhealthy everybody! See ya ✌️
